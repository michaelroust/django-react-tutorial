Stopped following yt video at 18:00 in order to understand what is going on.


Video Notes:
- Making The Registration View
  - Make api/serializer.py to transmit user data
  - In api/views.py create a CreateUserView that allows anyone to create a new user
- Connecting Our Auth Routes
  - In urls.py configure different urls.
  - Now save files and go to cli:
    - `python manage.py makemigrations`
    - `python manage.py migrate`
- Creating Custom Models (notes, models, ticket!, some "dataclass")
  - todo
